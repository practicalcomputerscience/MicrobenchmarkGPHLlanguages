# Potential "C++ successors": which one to take?

In reference to page [Potential "C successors": which one to take?](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/85%20-%20C%20successors#potential-c-successors-which-one-to-take),
here's a rough collection of potential "C++ successors":

- D
- Go
- Eiffel
- Mojo
- Odin
- Pony
- Rust
- Zig

So far, only Go and Rust have become "big" already; Mojo and Zig will probably become bigger in my opinion.

And as I mentioned [before](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/01%20-%20presentation%20slides#overview-slides),
"C++ will be around for still many years to come...", also thanks to its ongoing evolution.
