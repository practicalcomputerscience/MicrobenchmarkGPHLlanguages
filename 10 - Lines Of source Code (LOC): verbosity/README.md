# Lines Of source Code (LOC): verbosity

This ranking list is arguably even more controversial than the ranking based on [execution times](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages?tab=readme-ov-file#the-1-second-execution-time-limit).

However, even with my limited knowledge I tried to make _idiomatic_ source code in every programming language. I think that naivety can even be a help here.

On the other side, there _are_ programs with more **lines of code** (LOC) than actually needed, with my Ada version being the most prominent example from my point of view:

> The true reason why my Ada program was so helpful was because of my incompetence! Originally, I wanted to use the Strings Edit library ..., but I was not able to figure out within an acceptable amount of time how to use such a third party library for Ada. Consequently, my Ada program has the most lines of source code with 231, the highest so far...

## LOC ranking list

programming language | LOC | comments
--- | --- | ---
Ada               | 231 | compiled, very mature language: lots of declarations and type definitions
Inko              | 224 | compiled, very young language: lots of user-defined functions
MLton Standard ML | 216 | compiled, very mature language: lots of user-defined functions
Roc               | 191 | compiled, very young, pure functional programming language: needs some user-defined functions
V                 | 179 | compiled, very young programming language: needs some user-defined functions
C3                | 163 | compiled, very young language: DStrings (dynamic strings) are (still) missing some functions that are available for Strings (fixed length) => some shuffling between DStrings and Strings
C                 | 148 | compiled, very mature language
OCaml             | 131 | compiled, mature language
Lua               | 130 | compiled, very mature language
Perl 5            | 130 | interpreted, very mature language: verbosity with if-then-else form of error handling when writing to files
Go                | 127 | compiled, mature language
Rust              | 126 | compiled, mature language
FreeBASIC         | 122 | compiled, mature language
Chapel            | 121 | compiled, mature language
Zig               | 121 | compiled, young language
Swift             | 114 | compiled, mature language
Common Lisp       | 114 | compiled, very mature language
Crystal           | 113 | compiled, young language
Racket Scheme     | 110 | compiled, mature language
Kotlin            | 109 | interpreted, young language (together with Java ecosystem)
C#                | 109 | interpreted, mature language (together with .NET ecosystem)
Clojure           | 102 | interpreted, mature language (together with Java ecosystem)
Scala             |  98 | interpreted, mature language (together with Java ecosystem)
Mojo              |  93 | compiled, very young language
PowerShell        |  90 | interpreted, very mature language (together with .Net ecosystem): profiting from concise (and fast) _System.Text.StringBuilder_ source code
Python            |  87 | interpreted, very mature language

## Number of user defined functions

..because I didn't find anything useful or reliably working in the (official) libraries:
