# Potential "C successors": which one to take?

Typically, a "C successor" is capable of supporting "system programming", at best being also a "portable assembly language", while still be capable of supporting "application programming":

language | upside | downside | comment
-- | -- | -- | --
C3 | a soft evolution of C | tiny ecosystem; some functionalities still need to be expanded | 
Checked C | a backward‑compatible extension of C | tiny ecosystem | 
Chrystal | -- | -- | not suitable for system programming: depends on garbage collection, has a relatively large runtime, doesn't offer fine‑grained memory control
Go | big ecosystem; starting in 2025, Microsoft officially supports it | it's not the most elegant programming language; at least one family of functions behaves dangerously differently from all other relevent languages | 
Nim | concise, "Pythonic" source code | still a small ecosystem; doesn't have an "elevator pitch selling point"; documentation of advanced concepts still needs to be improved | community broke apart, look for "nimskull"
Odin | focus on data‑oriented programming, not object‑oriented abstractions | tiny ecosystem; some functionalities still need to be expanded; documentation needs to be improved | 
Rust | big ecosystem; has now an important reference: the Linux kernel | a demanding language, influenced by functional programming | not suitable for programming of high-performance computer games
V | built‑in safety features | small ecosystem; basic functionalities still need to be expanded | 
Zig | growing ecosystem | still a fast moving target |
