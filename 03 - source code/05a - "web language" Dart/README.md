## Idea of Dart

Dart was an earlier effort than TypeScript to overcome the deficits of JavaScript. However, Dart evolved around its own ecosystem, with "front-end" and "back-end" in mind.

It allows to run (originally) Dart source code on a variety of plattforms.

In Linux, the "default mode" is to let the Dart virtual machine interpret Dart source code: _$ tbd_

Same like TypeScript, Dart source code for a web browser is (nowadays) transpiled to JavaScript first.

Portability of ./random_streams_for_perf_stats.exe ?!?

- Dart: have its own exe speeds diagram: programming_languages_exe_speeds_Dart.csv, tbd + put the AOT version into the master diagram: tbd

TBD
