# Array-oriented languages

I would ascribe some so called _array-oriented_ programming languages to a nearness to [functional programming](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages#functional-languages).

However, there are array languages which explicitly support the _combination of both functional and imperative styles_: https://www.nial-array-language.org/

Array languages, like the mother and father of all array languages **APL** (https://aplwiki.com/), are used to simulate technical systems, here a master piece example from Finland: https://www.dyalog.com/case-studies/simulation.htm, which can read real time input data from external sources (side effects!), here weather data from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.

Though I guess it's fair to say that what later became **Speakeasy** established array-oriented languages latest in 1965:
