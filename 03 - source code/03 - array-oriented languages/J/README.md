## Installation tips

I got me file _j9.6_linux64.tar.gz_, where everything is already compiled, from here: [System/Installation/J9.6/Zips](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/System/Installation/J9.6/Zips) at chapter "Linux / FreeBSD / OpenBSD ", extracted it and expanded my _PATH_ environment variable in the _~/.bashrc_ config file with:

```
TBD
```

Then, I started the _$ jconsole_ and there entered these commands ("J sentences") from chapter "Finish Installation" for more installations:

```
load 'pacman'
'install' jpkg '*'
exit 0
```

This will install 3 icons on the Ubuntu desktop in the lower right-hand corner.

TBD
