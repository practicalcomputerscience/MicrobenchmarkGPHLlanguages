- extra exe speed diagram: JavaScript, TypeScript + ReScript??

<br/>

# From "back-end" to "front-end" programming languages

These are quick implementations of the speed part of the microbenchmark program to be executed on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

Though web programming was not even on my long list, I got the idea to implement the microbenchmark program in web programming languages from two sources:

- ... [LunarML]() ...TBD: [random_streams_for_perf_stats.mjs](), and
- [Grooy](TBD) and it's natural nearness to Java, with Groovy being often described as a "scripting language for the Java Virtual Machine", and which "can largely be viewed as a superset of Java": [Introducing Groovy](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/groovy.html)

From that point on, it was only a small step to transpile program [random_streams_for_perf_stats.groovy](TBD), which is here annotated for speedy, static compilation,
with the help of "Big AI", here Duck.ai (because the [tsc compiler](TBD) tumbled over warnings):

- first, into [TypeScript](TBD), and
- then into [JavaScript](TBD), into which TypeScipt scripts are anyway transpiled before execution.

TBD
