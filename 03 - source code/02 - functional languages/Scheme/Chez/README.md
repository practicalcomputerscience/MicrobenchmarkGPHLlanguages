https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/

See some more information from here: [Chez Scheme (CS)](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/blob/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages/Scheme/Racket/README.md#chez-scheme-cs)

## Installation tips

From file _IMPLEMENTATION.md_:
> Chez Scheme is a bootstrapped compiler, meaning you need a Chez Scheme compiler to build a Chez Scheme compiler.

See also file _BUILDING_:

```
$ ./configure --pb
$ make bootquick XM=auto  # "auto" to build for an inferred machine type
TBD

$
```
