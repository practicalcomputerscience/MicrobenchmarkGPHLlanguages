## What Scheme dialects are still maintained?

After I implemented the "speed part" program in 4 different Scheme dialects, I made an overview table with the state of certain Scheme dialects:

![plot](./Scheme%20dialects%20-%20big%2C%20actively%20maintained.png)

..which is based on the listing as found here: _Scheme Containers - Available implementations - Big, actively maintained_ at: https://containers.scheme.org/ (*)

However, this list is now outdated, which can be seen at best from my point of view with **Kawa**, a Scheme dialect for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), see at ![Kawa](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages/Scheme/Scheme%20dialects%20on%20the%20Java%20Virtual%20Machine%20(JVM)).

My defintion of "maintained" was straightforward: has there been some update in the last 12 months?

Sources for 10 out of these 16 Scheme dialects - not all of them are "big" - have been updated in the last 12 months roughly according to my counting and 15 within the last three years - with the exception of Kawa.

Maintaining a computer programming language is important from my point of view (same source from above (*)):

> Many (if not most) implementations keep working for years after active maintenance has ended, requiring few if any patches.

This can be true or not, I've made both experiences:
- OCaml for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from 2015 for example still runs fine: (TBD)
- the last update of Kawa Scheme (for the JVM) is much younger and still I wasn't able to run the _make_ process without errors, see at ![Kawa](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages/Scheme/Scheme%20dialects%20on%20the%20Java%20Virtual%20Machine%20(JVM)), which has then become my showstopper with Kawa

## My 5 best practices with Scheme dialects

1. before coding in a Scheme dialect make sure that you have understood its limitations, but also look at the **SRFI**'s (Scheme Requests for Implementation: https://srfi.schemers.org/), and how these SRFI's are available, to help you overcome these limitations potentionally!
2. for **good execution speeds** with longer "sequences of data items" avoid lists as much as possible and use **vectors** instead; I'm sure that this applies to all Scheme dialects
3. in a targeted Scheme dialect get familiar with how to install **libraries**, mostly the Scheme SRFI's. There's a great chance that a library procedure, which is not included in an already installed (standard) library, can provide a (partly) solution to your problem. I learned that specifically documentation for installing libraries often sucks greatly in the Land of Scheme's!
4. **Racket** Scheme (https://racket-lang.org/) has the most "batteries already included" and is in average not the slowest Scheme dialect (though in average it's not the speediest dialect). This makes Racket the best Scheme dialect to check out first in my opinion. I think that for most hobby users Racket is just good enough, but may also need elaborate experimentation for satisfactory results
5. be carefull, with the exception of Racket Scheme, to use the usual Linux distribution installations (_$ sudo apt install ..._). Better download directly from GitHub ("<> Code" ---> "Download ZIP") and compile and install according to the given instructions. Otherwise you may end up with an installation with "no
batteries included". This happend to me with Gambit Scheme! And often the Github versions are newer.

## What they don't tell you in the Land of Scheme's at first

After coding in a few Scheme dialects, I made these experiences:

- even with displaying "Hello, World!" on the console, there's a certain chance that you have to change the source code file when moving from one Scheme dialect to another!
- with the "Hello, World!" program for example due to needed but different imports and potentially (global) declarations
- having source code for the compiler or having commands ("expressions") for the interpreter (REPL) of a Scheme dialect may be a different thing in the lands of Lisp's and Scheme's. This may give you a false sense of security
- sometimes the differences may only emerge later during production, because a Scheme compiler (and build script) of one dialect may also produce a standalone, binary executable without any complaints from source(s) that have been "battle tested" in another Scheme dialect, only to cause a runtime crash during production! So, having sufficient tests is essential when moving from one Scheme dialect to another for a production ready program, specifically for rarely used, user defined functions
- [Racket](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages/Scheme/Racket) is no exception here according to my experience: it may be very easy to take source code meant for [Chez Scheme](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages/Scheme/Racket#chez-scheme-cs) for example without any changes and compile it (with: _$ raco exe < program name >.ss_ with file name extension _.ss_ for a Chez source code file) successfully into a Racket based standalone program - only to find out later that it runs differently - but without any crashes or error messages for example! This is potentially a worse scenario than a visible crash during runtime

This is not only my experience:

> A program written for one implementation is likely not to work with another one.

from 2018: http://fmnt.info/blog/20181029_scheme.html.

From https://wingolog.org/archives/2013/01/07/an-opinionated-guide-to-scheme-implementations:

> So don't fear implementation lock-in...

But this is exactly the situation with the fragmented Scheme ecosystem from my point of view, with maybe only these two exceptions:

- the new alliance of Chez Scheme and Racket: https://blog.lambdaclass.com/rebuilding-the-racket-compiler-with-chez-scheme/, and
- Bigloo, because this dialect has the support of the Inria (Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du num√©rique: https://www.inria.fr/fr)

This (informal) Chez Scheme-Racket alliance is a very clever move from my point of view, because it increases the chances of survival for both dialects for years to come in a fragmented Scheme ecosystem.

## System limitations

<br/>

### Vectors in Scheme

This refers to item #2 of [My 5 best practices with Scheme dialects](#my-5-best-practices-with-scheme-dialects) from above:

> ... Also like most Lisp dialects, Scheme has a built-in _vector_ datatype. Whereas a list is built out of out of interlinked but still separate objects, a vector is a single object. ... The reason for a separate vector datatype is efficiency. ... Hence vector lookup is a constant-time operation, whereas list lookup is O(n). ...

from: https://docs.scheme.org/guide/arrays/

So, I ended up with a lot of global (and dynamic) vectors - a very imperative programming style - in the first version (but not final version) of my Gambit Scheme program: [source code](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/blob/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages/Scheme/Gambit/random_streams_for_perf_stats.scm)

### Scheme for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)? (it's not looking good)

See from here: [Scheme dialects on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages/Scheme/Scheme%20dialects%20on%20the%20Java%20Virtual%20Machine%20(JVM))

<br/>

### Brackets in Scheme dialects

While porting my Scheme program to [Gambit Scheme](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages/Scheme/Gambit), I noticed that an expression like this:

```
(let ([...]
      [...])
     ...)
```

...to define local variables ("binding constructs") can only use round brackets ("parentheses") in Gambit:

```
(let ((...)
      (...))
     ...)
```

However, in the "Revised6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme" from 2007 (http://r6rs.org/final/r6rs.pdf) under chapter _4.3.2. Pairs and lists_ square brackets have been officially introduced:

> List and pair data, representing pairs and lists of values (see section 11.9) are represented using parentheses or brackets. Matching pairs of brackets that occur in the rules of „Äàlist„Äâare equivalent to matching pairs of parentheses.

Even with latest version 4.9.6 Gambit won't let you compile _([...])_ due to "Ill-formed binding".

<br/>

### Two more Scheme dialects

Here I bring the attention to two more Scheme dialects, which I didn't test though, which may provide interesting features:

- [IronScheme](https://github.com/IronScheme/IronScheme) which "aims to be a R6RS conforming Scheme-like implementation for all .NET implementations and platforms", and
- [LIPS Scheme](https://lips.js.org/), which allows to "mix Scheme and JavaScript. You can access all JavaScript objects. You can also call any functions from Scheme."
