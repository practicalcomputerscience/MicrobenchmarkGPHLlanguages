# Gambit Scheme

https://gambitscheme.org/

---

Gambit Scheme is quasi the Canadian branch of Scheme and is maintained since many years by Marc Feeley from Université de Montréal: https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/department-directory/professors/professor/in/in14344/sg/Marc%20Feeley/

It's the basis of at least another Scheme dialect, that is [Gerbil Scheme](https://cons.io/).
