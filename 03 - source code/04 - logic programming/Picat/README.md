# Picat: further development of the old B-Prolog

> Picat is a .. logic-based multi-paradigm programming language aimed for general-purpose applications.
> Picat is a rule-based language, in which predicates, functions, and actors are defined with pattern-matching rules.

First question first: with its B-Prolog legacy, is Picat still a Prolog system?

So, let's make this [test](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/04%20-%20logic%20programming/Mercury#concepts-of-mercury) in the Picat REPL:

(TBD)

B-Prolog and [XSB Prolog](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/04%20-%20logic%20programming/Prolog#xsb-prolog) have common roots in SB-Prolog (1987), see again at: [Fifty Years of Prolog and Beyond](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/article/fifty-years-of-prolog-and-beyond/3A5329B6E3639879301A6D44346FD1DD), on page 798.




Re _actors_: though I'm not using them here, actors have been a new major feature of B-Prolog: TBD

(TBD)
