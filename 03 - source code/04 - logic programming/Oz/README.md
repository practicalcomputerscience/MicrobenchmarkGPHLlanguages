# Oz

Development and execution environment **Mozart** (version 2): http://mozart2.org/

Oz cheat sheet from 2019: https://github.com/alhassy/OzCheatSheet/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf

At the moment, Oz, now in Version 3, and Mozart feel like a big, almost abandoned construction site with numerous dead links in the web,
here for example for Oz version 2: https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/oz2/documentation/, or links to just outdated but still useful documentation (https://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/),
since also current Mozart version 2.0.1 is still using many old parts.

Therefore, I often look into its GitHub repository to see what functions are currently available and how to use them, like here for [lists](https://github.com/mozart/mozart2/blob/83c83da2f670fbd1d08d4145eca3d88f1687582c/lib/main/base/List.oz) for example.

## Concepts of Oz

Maybe this computer programming book of two of the later developers became more famous:

..than the language itself.

Oz feels like that its supported programming paradigms are existing in parallel, which stands in contrast to layered [Mercury](TBD) with logic programming as the clear bottom layer for example.

Oz has a strong focus on teaching computer programming, and this doing so with means of a graphical user interface (GUI), that is 




This , which is not so easy, but possible.



## Installation und usage tips

Installation in a Linux system is easy with just downloading the suitable package and installing it with the related packager manager (by double clicking on the package),
here file _mozart2-2.0.1-x86_64-linux.deb_ from: https://github.com/mozart/mozart2/releases/tag/v2.0.1 for a Debian based Linux system like Ubuntu.

Also shell commands to start Oz and Mozart tools are now avaiable.

But the bigger question now is: how to start an Oz compiler or interpreter from a Linux shell like for example with Prolog systems?

After some tinkerung, I found this solution:
