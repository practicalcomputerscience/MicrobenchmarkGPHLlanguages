# Logic Programming 

- LP = Logic Programming
- CLP = Constraint Logic Programming
- CHR = Constraint Handling Rules
- SLD = Selective Linear Definite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLD_resolution): "logic programming, as a procedural interpretation of SLD resolution"; see at: [Absys: the first logic programming language —A retrospective and a commentary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0743106690900309?via%3Dihub)

Here is a good overview paper on Prolog, "arguably the most prominent language under the logic programming (LP) umbrella", and Prolog-like systems, published in 2022 at the anniversary of Prolog: [Fifty Years of Prolog and Beyond](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/article/fifty-years-of-prolog-and-beyond/3A5329B6E3639879301A6D44346FD1DD).

It looks like that significantly more implementations and derivatives of Prolog have been created over time than implementations and derivatives of [Scheme](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/02%20-%20functional%20languages/Scheme#scheme) for example.

I noticed one Prolog implementation, _hProlog_, written in C (*), which once was a leader in execution speed, here a presentation from 2004:

..only to see that hProlog cannot be even found in the maintained [Prolog and Logic Programming Historical Sources Archive](https://softwarepreservation.computerhistory.org/prolog/).
