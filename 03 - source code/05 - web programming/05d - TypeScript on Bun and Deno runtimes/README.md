I discovered these rather new node.js replacements here: [Languages](https://github.com/bddicken/languages?tab=readme-ov-file#languages) and here: https://benjdd.com/languages2/

..and just wanted to compare their execution times with of the [TypeScript](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/blob/main/03%20-%20source%20code/05%20-%20web%20programming/05a%20-%20web%20languages%20on%20node.js%2C%20WebAssembly%20and%20Wasmtime/random_streams_for_perf_stats.ts) program on node.js: [Complete execution speeds diagram](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/05%20-%20web%20programming/05a%20-%20web%20languages%20on%20node.js%2C%20WebAssembly%20and%20Wasmtime#complete-execution-speeds-diagram)

# Bun

https://bun.com/, which uses the V8 JavaScript engine, same like node.js

TBD

# Deno

https://deno.com/, which uses [Safari browser's](https://www.apple.com/safari/) JavaScriptCore engine

TBD

## Microbenchmark in TypeScript: execution speeds on Bun, Deno and node.js diagram
