## Non-idiomatic name formatting

Also with web languages, I try to keep module/object/class names _random_streams_for_perf_stats_ and _random_bitstring_and_flexible_password_generator_ as "snake case" names as much as possible 
(it's _Random_streams_for_perf_stats_ in ReScript).

These kind of names are often non-idiomatic names in web programming, because JavaScript, and related languages, usually use "camel case" for naming variables, though the [ECMAScript Language Specification](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) doesn't make any specification here. 

However, a somehow common, but not ideologic, naming convention for as much programming languages as possible is useful to me for easier searching and eventual error correction.
