## Idea of Dart

At first, I also wanted to cramp Dart into page [From "back-end" to "front-end" programming languages, and back](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/05%20-%20%22web%20languages%22%20on%20node.js%2C%20WebAssembly%20and%20Wasmtime#from-back-end-to-front-end-programming-languages-and-back).

But then I discovered that Dart right from start evolved around its own and rich ecosystem, with "front-end" and "back-end" in mind, which allows Dart source code to run on a variety of plattforms.

By the way: Dart was an earlier effort than TypeScript to overcome the deficits of JavaScript.

So, I came to the conclusion that Dart deserves it's own page. 

I think that specifically Dart is one of those languages that right from start had "blurrying the lines" in mind:

> With WebAssembly and specifically Wasmtime, where source code has a good chance to no longer "meet" some JavaScript code, the line between "back-end" and "front-end" programming languages has become blurry in the last couple of years.

In Linux, the "default mode" is to let the Dart virtual machine interpret Dart source code: _$ tbd_

Same like TypeScript, Dart source code for a web browser is (nowadays) transpiled into JavaScript first.

Portability of ./random_streams_for_perf_stats.exe ?!? _bash: ./random_streams_for_perf_stats.exe: cannot execute: required file not found_

--> make a proper Dart project here first: tbd

TBD
