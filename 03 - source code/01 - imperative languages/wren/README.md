[Lua](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/01%20-%20imperative%20languages/Lua#lua) brought me to wren.

However, MS Copilot Search just told me that wren has a _StringBuilder_ (_import "string" for StringBuilder; var sb = StringBuilder.new()_) for my prompt: "fast string concatenation in wren".

[wren](https://github.com/wren-lang/wren) does not have a string builder. This means that plain string concatenation is used here, which is very slow with one program run taking over 30 seconds:

Though, technical this script works OK.

This means two things:
