As usual, see the related [language description slide, Part 3](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/01%20-%20presentation%20slides#overview-slides) for what (good) things I say about C#.

#### Installation tips

Both source code files must have name _Program.cs_ in their related project directories. (Here they are just named differently to store them in the same GitHub directory.)

Otherwise, see the [source code](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/blob/main/03%20-%20source%20code/01%20-%20imperative%20languages/C%23/random_bitstring_and_flexible_password_generator.cs) for installation and building advice.
