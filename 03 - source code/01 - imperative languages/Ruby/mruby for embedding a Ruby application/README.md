# mruby to make a standalone Ruby based app

There are a couple of documents which try to explain how to work with [mruby](https://mruby.org/):

- [Executing Ruby code with mruby](https://mruby.org/docs/articles/executing-ruby-code-with-mruby.html)
- [Mruby: Beyond "hello world"](https://katafrakt.me/2024/10/05/mruby-beyond-hello-world/) from 2024

..but in the end it was Big AI (Google AI) which clearly explained me what to do.
