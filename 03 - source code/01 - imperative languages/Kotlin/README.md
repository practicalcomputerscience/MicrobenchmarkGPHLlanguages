# Kotlin

Kotlin is the better Scala in my opinion.

If Scala from Switzerland (https://scala.epfl.ch/) doesn't ramp up its efforts, it could end up as an academic language in my opinion. Kotlin is also ready for enterprise level software development, think of Google Maps and Google Drive and their association with Kotlin:

- https://medium.com/@sergei.rybalkin/upload-file-to-google-drive-with-kotlin-931cec5252c1

Kotlin also shines with a high quality language documentation in my opinion: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html
