PowerShell is an underrated programming language in my opinion, even though it's not the fastest, though it's not super-slow either: [Master diagram with most program environments](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/02%20-%20execution%20times#master-diagram-with-most-program-environments)

For scripting tasks I don't mind if a language is a bit slower than others. I wonder if Microsoft did this by design, at least for Linux.

<br/>

For the question: "Is a Powershell script being executed on a virtual machine?", I would refer to this mini-chapter in [C#](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/01%20-%20imperative%20languages/C%23#virtual-machine) and say "yes" again.

Microsoft says [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/lang-spec/chapter-01?view=powershell-7.5):

> Unlike most shells, which accept and return text, Windows PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Framework common language runtime (CLR) and the .NET Framework, and accepts and returns .NET Framework objects.
