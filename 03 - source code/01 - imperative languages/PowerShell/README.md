PowerShell is an underrated programming language in my opinion, even though it's not the fastest, though it's not super-slow either: [Master diagram with most program environments](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/02%20-%20execution%20times#master-diagram-with-most-program-environments)

For scripting tasks I don't mind if a language is a bit slower than others. I wonder if Microsoft did this by design, at least for Linux.
