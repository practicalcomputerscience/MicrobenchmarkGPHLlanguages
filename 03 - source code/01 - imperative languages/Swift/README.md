Swift may explain why you cannot make money with a (new) programming language apparently, only at its boundaries, that is when connecting to the outside world.

Or put differently: why is Apple's Swift (finally) [open source](https://github.com/swiftlang), but not [SwiftUI](https://swiftpackageregistry.com/OpenSwiftUIProject/OpenSwiftUI)?
