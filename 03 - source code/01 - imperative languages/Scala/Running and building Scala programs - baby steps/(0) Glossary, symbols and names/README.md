# Glossary, symbols and names

$ = Bash shell prompt (Linux; here Ubuntu 24 LTS); standard user

\> = Windows Terminal prompt ("cmd.exe")

Very often the same command should work 1:1 in Windows and Linux, or at least very similarly.

------

bloop = artefact from the Bloop build server tool: https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/

bsp = Build Server Protocol: a bsp configuration file (_scala.json_) makes a compiled Scala project also available to other IDEs (Integrated development environments) and build tools, where this file is then to be imported

CLI = Command Line Interface: accepts text input to interact with the with the Scala language for example: https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/

_$ coursier_ = "cs" = application and artifact manager to install Scala applications and setup your Scala development environment: https://get-coursier.io/, https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-overview

DOM (Document Object Model) API for interaction with a web page. The DOM representation as an object-oriented representation of a web page allows it to be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction

IDE = Integrated Development Environment

~.jar = Java Archive file

JDK = Java Development Kit

JRE = Java Runtime Environment: download from here: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

js = JavaScript

JVM = the OS-specific Java Virtual Machine, which is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE); as the **Scala program default execution case**, the scalac compiler compiles into platform-independent **Java bytecode**, which can then be executed through interpretation of just-in-time compilation (JIT): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-jdk-jre-jvm/ 

LLVM = "Low Level Virtual Machine": you don't need this; in Windows 11 you can use the _cl.exe_ compiler from a "C++ Workload" with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170); and in Linux you install the _clang_ compiler: $ sudo apt install clang

nodejs = node.js = open-source JavaScript runtime environment: https://nodejs.org/en/

OS = operating system (here Windows or Linux)

_$ sbt_ = simple build tool: https://www.scala-sbt.org/

_$ scala_ = Scala code runner tool: https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html; it acts as a wrapper around the _scalac_ compiler

_$ scala-cli_ = Scala shell, that is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language: https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/

_$ scalac_ = Scala compiler: https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/compiler-options/index.html

Scala.js = a compiler to write Scala code that runs in browsers, Node.js, and serverless environments: https://www.scala-js.org/

Vite = frontend build tool for web applications: https://vite.dev/ 

Yarn = one of the main JavaScript package managers: https://yarnpkg.com/
