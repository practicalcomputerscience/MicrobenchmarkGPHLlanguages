This documentation starts at subpage: [Running and building Scala programs: baby steps](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/blob/main/03%20-%20source%20code/01%20-%20imperative%20languages/Scala/Running%20and%20building%20Scala%20programs%20-%20baby%20steps/README.md#running-and-building-scala-programs-baby-steps)

Originally, these pages have been created in April 2025 for another GitHub account and have now been moved to this account, albeit re-structured with even more subpages for even better orientation.

So, this documentation may be already outdated in the fast evolving environment of Scala.
