# Fortran

https://fortran-lang.org

The fact that Fortan doesn't have an integrated **standard library** is a bummer (https://stdlib.fortran-lang.org/): 

> The Fortran Standard, as published by the ISO (https://wg5-fortran.org/), does not have a Standard Library.

This requires thinking about a workflow how to get _reasonable_ access to this standard library, and its useful functions, in your system without starting another monster configuration process.

## Installation tips

I installed Fortan, that is installing its compiler, from Ubuntu's package manager as recommended here at: [Hello world](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart/hello_world/)

```
$ sudo apt install gfortran
$ gfortran --version
GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0

```
