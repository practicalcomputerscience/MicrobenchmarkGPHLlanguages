# Fortran

https://fortran-lang.org

---

## Installation tips

I installed Fortan, that is installing its compiler, from Ubuntu's package manager as recommended here at: [Hello world](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart/hello_world/)

```
$ sudo apt install gfortran
$ gfortran --version
GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0
Copyright (C) 2023 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
...
$
```

I also installed the Fortran Standard Library:

- https://stdlib.fortran-lang.org/
- https://github.com/kz6fittycent/stdlib

..because it features useful functions. For Ubuntu I used snap: _$ sudo snap install stdlib_ from here: https://snapcraft.io/install/stdlib/ubuntu
