# Wiki page for further advances

2025-10-20: all major advances starting with scripting language [wren](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/01%20-%20imperative%20languages/wren#wren) and all major changes of existing documentation will be noted here - as my plan :wink:

2025-10-27: so far, I haven't touched yet these corners of programming languages:

- **Land of Erlang's**, here languages on its virtual machine BEAM (https://github.com/llaisdy/beam_languages); maybe:
- &nbsp;&nbsp;Gleam as a statically typed, functional language: work in progress
- &nbsp;&nbsp;LFE: Lisp Flavoured Erlang: https://lfe.io/about/
- Julia as a contender to Mojo and Chapel: https://julialang.org/; although, I still think that the world doesn't need another "scientific computing" programming language
- **[Array-oriented languages](https://github.com/practicalcomputerscience/MicrobenchmarkGPHLlanguages/tree/main/03%20-%20source%20code/03%20-%20array-oriented%20languages#array-oriented-languages)**; maybe:
- &nbsp;&nbsp;**GNU Octave** (https://octave.org/) as a shell script for an imperative array language
- &nbsp;&nbsp;ELI - A System for Programming with Arrays: https://fastarray.appspot.com/index.html: the documentation is showing user input and writing to files, something this microbenchmark program needs
- &nbsp;&nbsp;The Nial Language: https://www.nial-array-language.org/
- **Fortran** as the mother and father of all high-level programming languages: https://fortran-lang.org/
- Odin: https://odin-lang.org/
- Dylan: https://opendylan.org/download/: _Dylan is a direct descendant of Scheme and CLOS (without the Lisp syntax).._ (CLOS = Common Lisp Object System)
- Pure Programming Language is a functional programming language:
- &nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/agraef/pure-lang/wiki
- &nbsp;&nbsp;https://agraef.github.io/pure-lang/
- D?? --> https://github.com/jinyus/related_post_gen => D faster than Mojo?
- Nim?? --> https://github.com/phillvancejr/Cpp-Go-Zig-Odin
- **Stack-oriented programming languages**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)
- &nbsp;&nbsp;2025: _Implementing Forth in Go and C_: https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/implementing-forth-in-go-and-c/
- Hy is a Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python: https://hylang.org/
- https://haxe.org/: strictly-typed programming language
- Smalltalk as the U.S.'s start into object-oriented programming
- **Logic programming**: Prolog: https://www.iso.org/standard/21413.html
- Haskell (I'm not sure if I'll do it)
